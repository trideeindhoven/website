The fact that you wanted to suggest in the article (as FTM told the client) that Lydis In that context, deliberately concealing security issues speaks volumes about your malicious intentions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is interesting because i now have a legal document from a Dutch lawyer stating a <em>conspiracy theory</em> about myself. But joking aside: i am not a 007 in any way and the reason i have been doing this research lies a few years back in time. It stated in 2016 when my telecommunications business received a new large order to supply a rather substantial locations with new telephony equipment. Right after the equipment arrived my father died. Because of how the Dutch telecommunication market works delaying the installation of the phones was not an option and i was faced with a hard deadline.</p>
<p>During the week of the funeral i was busy arranging sending out invitations, picking out a casket during the day and in the evenings and nights i was working on configuring everything to make the deadlines. This lead to some unexpected side effects. For example: robberies during a funeral are really common in The Netherlands, so i needed to hire a private security company to guard the house of my parents during the funeral. On the day of the funeral i got in my car with my mother and sister. When the hurse started driving of i looked back at the house where the hired security guy was standing in the doorway. The absurdity of the situation hit me and i could only think: &ldquo;This, never again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few weeks later i started building my own provisioning system for all the main brands in telecommunication. This way i could dropship telecommunication equipment to my customers and when plugged in for the first time the phones would configure themselves.
As a brand with 70% marketshare in The Netherlands obviously Yealink was also part of this provisioning system. And from the start it was clear to me there were some inconsistencies with Yealink equipment that i could not explain. At that time i did not immediately correlate this with a potential security issue or issues. But it was always in the back of my mind. During the summer of 2022 i decided to have a better look at the security aspects of the provisioning system.</p>
