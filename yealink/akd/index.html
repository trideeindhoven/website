The name of this legal firm is relevant because this is not a small legal firm. AKD has build itself quiet a reputation. In 2022 research by Follow The Money showed that AKD did not <a href="https://www.ftm.nl/artikelen/deze-advocatenkantoren-nemen-geen-afstand-van-kremlin">distance itself from the Kremlin</a>. I was highly surprised i received a summon from a lawfirm that, until recently, was working for Russian state-owned companies that were involved in the nuclear industry.
The summon was very clear: AKD&rsquo;s client Lydis was loosing money fast because of the publication in <a href="https://www.ftm.eu/articles/yealink-security-questions">Follow The Money</a>. The summon was very specific about the amount of money lost by Lydis. It mentioned an amount of 7 million euro and if i was not going to be very careful this amount was going to be collected at&hellip;me!</p>
<p>This is an important aspect because if i had to pay 7 million euro to Lydis this would mean i was going to be homeless and my life was going to be ruined. Apparently the stakes for Lydis were this high that they were willing to do that to a Dutch security researcher who had, for free, worked with them for a year to point out several security issues. I think this should be a major factor if you want to do business with a company that is doing sustainable business. It is hard to maintain a sustainable image if you want to ruin someone&rsquo;s life for asking, arguably, difficult questions.</p>
